      '--pairing-address changes only the client-advertised address; use a reachable LAN, Tailscale, SSH-forward, or reverse-proxy endpoint.',
      'Use --recipe-json with --project-root from VM recipes to print the recipe result JSON and leave the server running.',
      "A paired client cannot drive this machine's desktop (axiom computer) unless the offer was created with --grant-desktop-control.",
      'When the web client bundle is available, the server also prints a browser URL with the pairing data embedded.',
      'Exits with code 3, without starting anything, when another Axiom already serves this profile or cannot be shown to have stopped.',
      'On macOS, after Axiom serve aborts at startup (it could not register with Launch Services), later runs from the same environment refuse for 30 minutes with exit code 78. Use --force to try anyway.',
      '--supervise is for service managers (launchd, systemd). Axiom serve then restarts the server itself with growing delays instead of exiting when it stops, waits while an update replaces the app, and waits while another Axiom serves this profile. After 6 failures in 15 minutes it gives up and exits with code 0 so the manager stops too, and later supervised runs refuse until a new build is installed or --force is passed. Not available on Windows yet.',
      'Experimental and off by default: set ORCA_TERMINAL_PROCESS_CEILING=<n> (64 or more) before the terminal host starts to have the OS cap how many processes each terminal may run (Linux, through a systemd user scope per terminal, which needs a user manager that outlives logout; Windows, through a job per terminal). `axiom serve` reports the ceiling as on or off, with the reason.',
      'Off by default: set ORCA_TERMINAL_MEMORY_MAX=<size> (256M or more) and ORCA_TERMINAL_MEMORY_SWAP_MAX=<size> (0 for no swap) before the terminal host starts to cap the memory and swap of each terminal on Linux, through the same per-terminal systemd user scope. A terminal over its limit has its largest process OOM-killed; the host and other terminals keep running. Sizes take K, M, G or T. A limit the host cannot enforce is skipped and logged in the terminal host log. No effect on macOS or Windows.'

    notes: [
